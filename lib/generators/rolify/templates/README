An initializer file has been created here: config/initializers/rolify.rb, you 
can change rolify settings to match your needs. 
Defaults values are commented out.

A Role class has been created in app/models (with the name you gave as 
argument otherwise the default is role.rb), you can add your own business logic 
inside.

Inside your User class (or the name you gave as argument otherwise the default 
is user.rb), rolify method has been inserted to provide rolify methods.

Before migrating you will need to edit the migration file and specify the Rails version on the ActiveRecord::Migration class, for example ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0].
